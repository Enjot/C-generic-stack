# C generic stack

✅ C generic stack implementation (changing the used data type wouldn't affect the stack code itself)  
✅ based on void* pointers  
✅ generic push, pop, peek, clear, find at-depth operations  
✅ finding elements by depth and by custom comparing criteria (provided by data type)  
✅ saving and loading to a binary file  
✅ error and message handling  
✅ simple console user interface  
✅ pointer types dynamically allocated and dynamically saved to file to reduce file size  
✅ ✨ checked for memory leaks by using Valgrind, no leaks found
